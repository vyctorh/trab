% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with

\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithm2e}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}

%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}

% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

  Smart Grids are the evolution of the current electric system to meet the challenge of increasing demands for energy in this century by integrating the electric grid with data communication network. The challenge of this network is to fulfill safety requirements: reliability and resilience required in order to meet various types of services and applications. The use of wireless mesh networks can provide scalability and resilience to this communication network, but there are challenges that need to be evaluated and analyzed so that it is in fact a solution for communications in Smart Grids. This paper proposes an algorithm for dynamic selection of gateways in a multihoming Smart Grid network improving performance when a gateway's fault occurs due to a probabilistic choosing gateways with good metrics. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm makes the routing protocol more robust and resilient against gateway's fault compared to a deterministic algorithm for dynamic gateway selection.

\section{Introduction}
Basically the current electrical system has an outdated hierarchical architecture that does not meet the future demands of energy consumption due to various limitations such as limited generation capacity, one-way flow of energy (generation–transport–distribution–consumption) and communication,  low and deficient communication, the use of fossil fuels in power generation and reliability problems \cite{Farhangi2010}. 
Modernization the existing electricity grid aims to solve these problems, improving efficiency, reliability and security, integrating the use of renewable energy produced by consumers, making the one-way flow in two-way flow for energy and communication \cite {Farhangi2010,Moslehi2010}. Two-way communication infrastructure is essential for Smart Grids \cite{Gungor2011}, because it needs to send commands and to receive information from its components and sensors  in real time, with reliably, allowing monitoring, maintenance and control of the entire grid. 

Smart Grids require two-way communication that has specificities of delay, bandwidth, frequency of updates, reliability, security and time response for each distinct application in their different fields \cite{Gungor2011}. Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is fundamental and the first step to realize a Smart Grid\cite{4781067,5484223}. Your security requirements should provide robustness and resilience to prevent or recover from cyber attacks or problems caused by interference, providing the stability and reliability to AMI communication. This communication may use available wired or wireless technologies that support the exchange information between components of AMI \cite{Saputro2012,4547164}. Different types of technologies can be used: cellular technology \cite{5589988}, WiMAX, ZigBee \cite{5589988}, RF Mesh \cite{5622071}, IEEE 802.11-based Wireless Mesh Networks (WMN) and PLC \cite{5479945}. 

PLC (\emph{Power Line Communication}) is the most used wired technology \cite{Saputro2012}, but has limitations. In case of failures, such as physical disruption of power lines, would not be possible to maintain communication between AMI components \cite{Gungor2006}. Wireless networks offer more benefits than wired networks such as lower cost, ease of deployment and the available signal in a large area \cite{5589988}. Among all wireless technologies WMN has advantages compared to single-hop infrastructure network architecture, because it communicates in multi-hop way that extends the coverage of the network and allowing communication with alternative paths in case of failures in links \cite{5622071,Fang2012}. 

The challenge is to adapt WMN to communication requirements required by AMI, where hundreds of meters communicate with Utility's head-end through DAP (Data Aggregation Point), which are the gateways of this network. This large number of nodes is the main challenge for the WMN \cite{Akyildiz2005}, since more than 100 meters may be associated to one DAP. If they  send data simultaneously should cause congestion to the network. A way to reduce this problem is the use of multiple DAP. There are other problems related to the propagation conditions of the external environment that provide attenuation, interference and variation to the signal strength \cite{Gungor2011}. The routing protocol must be able to find reliable routes to improve performance and meet the requirements of AMI network.

The new wireless communication devices have the capacity to operate in different transmission rates and are sensitive to propagation conditions generating another challenge for routing and its metric. The latter should take into account the fluctuations of link quality and transmission
rate for consistent assessment of costs.

Given the problems faced by routing protocol in WMN to comply with AMI communication requirements, we propose an algorithm that dynamically selects a DAP for communication between meters and headend. In this problem, we assumed that each meter can connect, through multiple hops, to a set of DAP. The main goal of this algorithm, called Dynamic Selection Algorithm (DDSA), is to increase the reliability, robustness and resiliency using multiple DAP by meters thus improving performance in a presence of DAP's failure, since there is the probability of choosing other DAP for communication with the headend.

The organization of the paper is as follows. In Section II, discloses the particularities of the AMI communication network and its challenges and problems. Section III presents related work. Section IV describes and explains the working principle of DDSA. Section V presents the results obtained in the simulations. Section VI concludes the paper and presents ideas for future work.



\section{Background}

\subsection{A Brief Overview of AMI}


The modernization of the current electricity grid involves a large use of information technology to move the current system towards Smart Grid using communication that allows bidirectional flow of information between the different subsystems and the headend. Nearly 8\% of all energy generated is lost along the transmission lines and 20\% of the total generation capacity is only to supply peak demands, which represent only 5\% of the total demand \cite{Farhangi2010}. About 90\% of power outages and disturbances are assigned to distribution subsystem, thus the success of a Smart Grid depends on the deployment of an interconnected distribution subsystem. 

AMI is the main application of distribution subsystem that aims to improve the reliability and  a change in paradigm  to one where customer demand adjusts to the power generation. AMI is basically composed of smart meters, gateways or DAP and  Utility's headend, all interconnected by a communication network. 
The headend is connected to multiple DAPs, which in turn has connections to  multiple smart meters.
The meters send the measurement data to the headend through DAP and this traffic is characterized by the exchange of short messages.  

These messages have a payload that varies from tens to hundreds of bytes and are sent periodically, typically in a 15 minutes interval, and remain inactive the rest of the time \cite{SRS:13,4547164}. They can be sent in a single data packet originated by meters connected to a DAP. The headend can send commands and requests to meters also through DAP.


\subsection{Problem Statement}

According \cite{Gungor2013}, it is necessary for each meter a band from 10 to 100 Kbps and the latency should be less than 2000 ms. Since investments in the power sector are long-lasting, it is desirable that the AMI should also support long-term operations \cite{5484223}. New necessities for information may arise and making the requirements more stringent such as latency that should be less than hundreds or tens of milliseconds in applications that need information in real time.

The AMI traffic can be classified into regular and on-demand. It's regular when data consumption are automatically sent by the meters at predetermined intervals time \cite{Plan2011,4547164} and constitute the majority of data traffic flowing through AMI \cite{5484223}. The on-demand traffic is constituted of alert messages from meters, command and control sent by the headend  to meters and DAP and the responses to these commands \cite{Plan2011}. In the latter type of traffic can occur a greater increase in network congestion due to the request for sending information,  by  headend to a large numbers of meters, that would send simultaneously this data. DAP is a single point of failure, because all traffic between meters and headend or vice versa flows through it, a failure in it will stop the entire network from working.

The residential density of the area, which can be a dense urban area or rural area, determines the amount of meters per area, which according to \cite{Plan2011} can be classified into rural, suburban or urban scenario, with density varying from 10, 800 or 2000 meters per km\textsuperscript{2}, respectively. The external environment conditions in combination with the number of meter will determine the level of interference and attenuation in communication between meters and DAP will have. This may cause breaks in routes and loss of performance due to the increase in packet loss and retransmissions \cite{farooq2013energy}. 


Due to the peculiarities of the AMI network and a large amount of meters acting as routers/clients mesh, there is a possibility of problems with loops and broken route \cite{ramachandran2007routing}, causing a degradation in performance that may lead to a non-compliance with communication requirements. The density of the WMN varies with the number of households in the region which can be dense or a very sparse area. Thus the routing protocol should handle this variation, providing an acceptable level of service regardless of WMN density. Another problem is the increased amount of collisions near the DAP because all packets are routing to it \cite{Saputro2012}.

\section{Related Work}

The work in \cite{Gungor2006}  proposes the use of WMN in AMI where multiple domains of mesh networks are connected by a WiMAX backbone. This architecture provides redundant paths between meters eliminating problems like nodes failed and route break increasing their resilience and making network fault tolerant. However, as there is only one DAP acting as gateway in each WMN domain, if it becomes unavailable there will be no communication between the meters and the headend. This is the same problem \cite{Silva2010}, where the WMN consists of meters, routers and collectors. The meters communicate with routers or directly to collectors, the latter controls up to 25,000 meters and routers on a single network.

The work in \cite{Silva2010} makes use of multiple gateways to increase the WMN resilience, because in addition to providing redundant paths also provides redundancy of gateway. Another work that solves the problem of multiple gateways is \cite{ClaytonR.daSilva2011}  which also preserves the gateway output for each connection, but also adds load balancing. These approaches are applied to WMN that serve as the backbone for internet access. In these access networks is common to use the technique NAT (Network Address Translation), which does not exist in AMI, being necessary to preserve the connection with the gateway output and no breakage of TCP connections semantics occur.

The work in \cite{6412861} and \cite{Gharavi2011} are designed to suit the requirements of AMI networks and make use of multiple DAP for communication between meters and headend modifying the HWMP protocol (Wireless Hybrid mesh Protocol). The work in \cite{Gharavi2011} although solve the problem of discard of the queue, still suffers from other problems such as protocol stability of routes and loops that according to the authors is a characteristic of distributed backpressure system adopted by them. However, neither of them has been evaluated the protocol behavior in an environment with a DAP failure, nor using adaptation of transmission rate, which increases the problem of instability of routes. They use as a base protocol that has scalability problems and congestion caused by control messages \cite{5473885} making it difficult to use in AMI.


Our proposal DDSA makes use of multiple DAP for communication between meters and headend, and differs from \cite{6412861} and \cite{Gharavi2011} to be designed to improve performance in environments with DAP failure and also be independent of the routing protocol and metric, and can be implemented in that best suit the implementation of AMI.
In DDSA, each new send data, meters probabilistically choose DAP to which the data packet is sent through. 
Thus, improved performance and network resilience by distributing traffic among the DAP to each transmission, according to the probability of selection of each one, and provide resilience as if one is unavailable, it is possible to choose another.


\subsection{Routing Metrics}
 

MARA (Metric-Aware Rate Adaptation) \cite{6051505} is a mechanism that joins routing metric with rate adaptation for transmission in WMN through the concept of cross-layer design.
It uses statistical information of routing metrics to select the best rate and in turn, based on this choice, the metric can estimate the actual cost of the link.
Thus, metrics and rate adaptation share information and make decisions together resulting in better choices of routes by the routing protocol.
The calculation of the metric of a link is based on a conversion process in which first is estimated the SNR (Signal-to-noise ratio) from the link success probability of probe packets in a given transmission rate that can be of 1, 18, 36 or 54 Mbps.
With this SNR estimation is possible, by means of a probability function loss estimate the PER (Packet Error Rate) to other rates. Its advantage is that it solves the problem that metric and choice of rate are studied separately, although they are strongly related.


\section{DDSA (DAP Dynamic Selection Algorithm)}


The principle of the proposed algorithm is based on the calculation of the probability of selecting a DAP using information of routing metric to define a probability selection value to each DAP. Based in this value, it is determined which DAP is used by node and the higher the probability value greater are the chances of a DAP being chosen. The use of multiple DAP increases the reliability and performance of the routing, because it is possible to choose routes to headend using any DAP.

For each DAP $d_{j}$ is computed the probability $P_{(m_{i},d_{j})}$ to be selected by the meter $m_{i}$ and is 
given by the expression: \begin{center}$ P_{(m_{i},d_{j})} =  \frac {M_{(m_{i},d_{j})}}{\sum\limits_{k=1}^{N} M_{(m_{i},d_{k})}} $  \  , \end{center} where $ {M_{(m_{i},d_{j})}} $ is the value of the quality metric of the path $(m_{i},d_{j})$, which is divided by the sum of all metric values ​​of the meter $ m_ {i} $ for all DAP.

To prevent selection of DAP with worse metrics a threshold $\alpha$ is included in the algorithm. To do this, first the best metric is found then is computed its probability to be select. This probability is multiplied by $\alpha$, that have values between 0 and 1, giving a value that is compared with others DAP probability. If DAP probability is smaller than it then it is discarded. The threshold $\alpha$ is a parameter of the DDSA algorithm  that affects the performance and the behavior of network. A lower value of $\alpha$ implies  

The algorithm~\ref{prob} shows how the DAP choice is made for one meter $m_{i}$.

\section{Performance Evaluation}

\subsection{Simulation Environment}  

\subsection{Simulation Results}

Na figura~\ref{n16-dap} foi escolhido um nó localizado geograficamente com a mesma proximidade entre 2 DAP e no meio da rede ---- \textbf{explicar a semente}. Esta escolha é adequada para entendermos como é o comportamento da proposta na escolha dos DAP e o seu impacto no desempenho. Como visto, a escolha do \textbf{alfa} afeta o comportamento na escolha de DAP e notamos como o limiar mais baixo faz com que seja escolhido o DAP mais afastado e não somente os 2 mais próximos. O limiar mais alto faz com que a proposta faça escolhas alternando entre os 2 DAP mais próximos  com melhores métricas excluindo o terceiro DAP por possuir métrica pior. A referência (multi-dap) já não faz trocas entre os DAP, somente ao final é escolhido o DAP 2 por ter superado a métrica do DAP 1. Após a ocorrêcia da falha no tempo 300s verifica-se que este comportamento irá determinar como será o comportamento futuro após a ocorrência da falha do DAP 2 (fig~\ref{n16-dap2}). Notamos que a proposta com limiar de 30\% (fig~\ref{n16-dap2}(a)) o nó 16 sempre  entrega pacotes para um dos DAP. A proposta com limiar de 85\% (fig~\ref{n16-dap2}(b)) o comportamento foi diferente chegando a ficar 64 seg sem entregar um pacote para um dos DAP após a falha. A referência (fig~\ref{n16-dap2}(c)) notamos um comportamento mais sensível em relação à falha chegando a ficar 81 seg sem entregar um pacote para um dos DAP.

Para verificarmos este comportamento para outros nós foi somado todos os intervalos em que não houve recebimento de pacotes em qualquer um dos DAP (fig~\ref{sum-intv}). Percemos que este comportamento se repete para  os nós da região central da rede (nós 12 ao 23). COLOCAR A MÉDIA E EXPLICAR.  No nó 14 a proposta com limiar de 30\% somou 82 seg sem enviar pacotes, mas que ficou muito abaixo dos 166 seg da proposta com 85\% e da referencia com 187 seg. no total. Este nó e o nó 13 são os mais próximos do DAP  falho sofrendo mais influência desta falha.  média do multi 104,78 s, 85 106,86  30 14,57358




Na figura~\ref{pdf-n16-per} é analisado o comportamento de entrega de pacotes do nó 16 durante a falha em intervalos de 15 seg. Nota-se que no DDSA-30\% a queda na taxa não foi tão acentuada quanto nos outros ficando cerca de 48\% melhor que o DDSA-85\% e o Multi-DAP. Isto evidencia que a tendência de distribuir mais pacotes do DDSA-30\% entre os DAP o torna mais robusto que os outros quando ocorre uma falha de DAP.

\textbf{Colocar que é em todas as sementes} O comportamento de todos os nós é apresentado na figura~\ref{pdf-per-a} notamos que o DDSA-30\% tem um desempenho um pouco menor que os outros. Isto se deve ao fato dele fazer uso de DAP com métricas não tão boas e que estão distantes do nó de origem. Esta escolha reflete na sua performance ficando um pouco pior em relação aos outros que utilizam DAP com métricas melhores e mais próximos ao nó de origem. Em relação a região central da rede, a mais afetada pela falha do DAP, a situação se inverte (fig.~\ref{pdf-centro-per-b}) com o DDSA-30\% melhor 16,5\% que o DDSA-85\% logo após a falha e de até 17\% em relação ao Multi-DAP. Após o tempo 450 seg as curvas se cruzam demonstrando que a partir deste tempo a maioria dos nós tomam conhecimento da falha do DAP.

Por último na figura~\ref{fases} é apresentado um histograma comparando cada etapa da simulação onde temos o período antes da falha de 150s até 300s, durante a falha de 300s até 450s e de recuperação da falha de 450s até 650s. É observado que a região central da rede é a mais afetada pela falha do DAP. O DDSA-30\% é o menos afetado pela falha com resultados bem acima do DDSA-85\% e o Multi-DAP com a maioria dos nós da região central apresentando taxas muito baixas.
